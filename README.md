Configs & helper programs for the Samsung NP-Q1u
================================================

The NP-Q1u tablet is awesome for watching videos on and generally playing
around on, being a portable x86 PC. But the keyboard is weird as well as
awkward, offering no number keys at all - instead, the top home doubles as a
numpad (!= number keys).

This repository stores my specialised configs and scripts for making things
easier for you. It should be installed after my dotfiles repo.

To install, run `install`.

`EDIT_*` files will very likely require some other configuration. Search for
EDIT in them to find the important lines more quickly.
